# Transforming Context Free Grammar into "Chomsky Normal Form"

A Context Free Grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form
if every production has the form: A → BC or A → a

There are several logical Steps which should be performed in order to obtain the Chomsky Normal Form from a CFG:

1. Eliminate ε productions.
2. Eliminate any renaming.
3. Eliminate inaccessible symbols.
4. Eliminate the non productive symbols.
5. Obtain the Chomsky Normal Form.

In the file v21.txt can be found an example of Context Free Grammar for witch the Chomsky Normal Form is computed
